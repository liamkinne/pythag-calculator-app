## Outline
Making complex calculation of triangle side lengths simple though intuative visual representation and user oriented interfacing.

## Requirements

- [Java.lang Math Package](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/java_lang_math.htm)

## Pseudo Code

```
draw main window
draw A, B and C input fields
loop forever:
  if input values have changed -> redraw triangle with correct ratio
 ```
